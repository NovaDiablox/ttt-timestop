# ttt-timestop

Stop time for players around you.

## Features

This is a more configurable version of the [Time Stop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=860791968) addon by Vipes. This version allows you configure almost everything, from stop length, range, to immunity and random chance. See the ConVars below for more information.

This equipment is available for the Traitors in the Equipment menu. Using the Time Stop weapon stops time for all players within a radius of the user (configurable).

Includes an individual .vmt and .vtf shop icon.
